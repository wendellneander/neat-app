# NEAT App

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have **Yarn** installed on your machine.

### Installing Yarn

If you don't have Yarn installed, follow these steps:

1. **With npm** (recommended for most users):
 ```bash
 npm install --global yarn
 ```

2. **Check installation** by running:
 ```bash
 yarn --version
 ```

This command should return the version of Yarn if it was installed successfully.

## Running the Project

Once Yarn is installed, follow these steps to start the project:

1. Install all project dependencies by running:
 ```bash
 yarn
 ```

2. Start the development server with:
 ```bash
 yarn dev
 ```

The project should now be running locally. Access it at `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified port).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:
- You have the latest version of Node.js installed.
- You are in the correct directory for the project before running these commands.
